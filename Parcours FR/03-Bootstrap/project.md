# Project: First Bootstrap Site
The site is a portal site of a restaurant franchise. The franchise is fictional but the type of food (burger, pizza, Asian, ...) is left to the choice of the learner.

The site must be **responsive**: at least for small screens (xs) and medium screens (md)

Minimum 5 pages accessible by a navigation bar (navbar) present on all pages to the different sections: Home, Map, Photos, Restaurants, Contact.
If you want to make a more complete site with even more stuff, treat yourself!

### Composition of the website
At a minimum:
- A **Home page** with a Jumbotron component and two panels to display news (like promotions, news or events of the week)
- A **Menu page** with menus presented as a grouped list with badges (bootstrap badges)
- A **Photos page** with a photo gallery (minimum 10) and a pagination (3 photos by page)
- A **Restaurants page** with address, access map and opening hours of at least two restaurants (it's a franchise!)
- A **Contact page** with a contact form including last name, first name, e-mail, drop-down list (object of the message with a select and options)), a text field (for the message), a sending button with glyphicon. Put a label also on this page to indicate something
### Attention
