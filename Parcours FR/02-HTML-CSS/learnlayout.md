#Learn CSS layout

- On your computer create a folder named `learnlayout`
- Execute the command `git init` to start the project
- **Do not forget to commit at least 2 times a day**
- Go on [learnlayout.com](http://learnlayout.com/)
- Choose your native language (the goal here is to understand)
- For every example in the website copy them inside an `html` file ex : `exercise-1.html` or 'exercise-1-display.html'
- You are allowed to use the `<style>` tag to not to create CSS files
- **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE** (Big brother is watching you)
- Once you have finished follow this tutorial ["Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command
 line"](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) or this one ["Add Existing Project To Git"](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/102854243cd066f8b88e)
