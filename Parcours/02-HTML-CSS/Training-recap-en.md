# Multipage site, form and small graphic chart

Make a website for a shop or a fictitious craftsman in HTML and CSS with 4 pages:
- **home** : information on the activity of the craftsman or the shop
- **services** or **products** : image gallery AND / OR a table with services and rates
- **where to find us** : integration of a google map with a fictional address (if you really have no imagination, put: OlavarrÃ­a 143, 1879 Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina
)
- **contact** : basic contact form

### For the form
It should :
- **radio buttons** (for example: madam, sir)
- name fields
- email address fields
- **checkboxes** (products that interest the visitor?)
- a field that allows  to **select** among three **options** (for example: quote, complaint, love letter, request for info, ...)
- a field for the user to write long messages
- a **button** to send
- a **fieldset** to make it look pretty

### For texts
Use **Lorem Ipsum**.

Or if you have the time, write small texts for the content of their mini site. If possible, without misspelling.

### For the pictures
- Use royalty free images
- Use Gimp to crop, resize images. Other alternative => [Pixlr Editor](https://pixlr.com/editor/)

### For the logo:
Use a free [free logo generator](https://www.hipsterlogogenerator.com) (link example but there are others) and respect your own graphic charter.
