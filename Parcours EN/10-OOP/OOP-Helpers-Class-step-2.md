# OOP: Helpers Class : Step 2

## Objective

Create a `class HTML` (in a separate file) that will manage the different HTML elements :

- Linking of CSS files `<link rel="stylesheet" ...>`
- Creation of meta tags `<meta ...>`
- Linking images `<img src="...">`
- Creating anchor links `<a href="...">`
- Linking `Javascript` files

You have to create these classes while keeping in mind they should be useable for other developers.
Pay attention to naming of your methods and properties so they make sense, keep it simple and comment your code.
