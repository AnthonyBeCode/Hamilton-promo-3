# PHP Exercise

Create a file "excuse.php", and inside of it create an "excuses generator" to ease the life of parents with kids in primary school.

You need a form with three questions:
1. the name of the kid
2. the name of the teacher
3. a reason for absence to be chosen from options (type radio buttons)
  -sick
  -death of a pet (or family member)
  -important extra-curricular activity
  -any other excuse of your choice

For each option, invent an excuse that adapts in function to the chosen option.
Use a condition to display the right excuse.

Generate the full excuse using the three form answers.

The parent would only have to copy/paste the answer to write its letter of excuses.

## Development criteria for perfection
- display date of the day (format "Day, le dd Month YYYY")
- add the formula of politeness.
- no type-o's.
- good UX: make it feel like a real product? ( CSS + typegraphy + logo )
