## Project : Interview of a webdev

A website with as page :
- Making Of : How you found your webdev
- Presentation of the company where the interviewee works
- Presentation of webdev
- Interview (see the list of questions)
- Conclusion (analysis/personal impression)

We need an MVC :
- a **controller** folder with the router, the one that will redirect
- a **model** folder where we will put the PHP processing (you know, everything above the doctype)
- a **view** folder with all visual pages
- a **config.php** file with login information (user, password, login, host)
- a **connexion.php** file with the connection to DB
- a **index.php** file that includes the .php connection and config. and also the controller.

The list of questions is [available here](interviewwebdev.md).
